In this capstone project, I will explore the soccer player's best position and overall rating based on the different attributes. FIFA20 is a video game that is designed by the data collected from the real world, so it can be a good source to analyze data and build up the predictive model.

To get better insights and be familiar with the relationship between features and targets, I start the analysis by displaying some visualizations at the beginning. Firstly, I design a function to display Top 10 clubs and nationalities that have the highest overall rating:
### Top 10 clubs

### Top 10 national teams

### Player's value vs 7 different positions

### Player's wage vs 7 different positions
